# LeetCodeSolutions

A collection of each LeetCode problem I have completed along with documentation explaining the solutions I arrived at for each problem.

## Structure

The "Problems" folder contains each problem I have completed in its own dedicated folder in the order they appear in the LeetCode problem set. Each problem folder contains sub-folders of my solutions to the problem, divided by how the solution was optimized (for time complexity or space complexity, in that order). Each of these sub-folders contains the associated solution's code and a markdown file, written in the style of LeetCode solution submissions, explaining the associated solution.


## About Me

My name is Christopher Siems and I am a current computer science student at Clark University. I am putting together this repo to keep track of my work as I work my way through the LeetCode problem set and, hopefully, help anyone doing the same with understanding the solutions to the problems we are both facing. Please feel free to follow, fork, and report issues with this repo. Follow me here, on GitHub, find me on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/ChristopherKS/), or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-siems/).
